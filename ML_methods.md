# Machine Learning Method Summaries

## Decision Trees

#### What assumptions does it make about the data?

#### What is it optimizing for?
A decision tree minimizes entropy in the data that it is splitting, which in turn maximizes information gain. The implementation of this model in sci-kit learn can also optimize for "gini" which is functionaly equivalent. 

#### What parameters does it have?

#### How are those parameters selected?

#### How you score new data with it?

#### How do you interpret the model and its predictions?

- **Complexity?** Low
- **Likely to Overfit?** Yes 
- **Interpretability?** High
- **Training Time?** Depends on the depth of the tree and number of features. 
- **Testing/Scoring Time?** Slow, Medium, Fast
